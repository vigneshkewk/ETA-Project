Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for deliveries using machine learning techniques. The model is trained using historical data and can be deployed for real-time ETA predictions through a Streamlit web application.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to estimate the time it takes for a delivery to arrive at its destination. Machine learning models are employed to analyze historical delivery data and predict ETA based on factors like distance, traffic conditions, time of day, and more. The project is deployed via a web interface using Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization of predictions.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand patterns in delivery data.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Model Building: Training models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict ETA.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Streamlit Application: A web-based interface to interact with the model and get real-time predictions.
Data
The dataset contains the following key features:

Distance: Distance between the origin and destination.
Traffic Conditions: Levels of traffic at the time of the delivery.
Weather: Weather conditions during the delivery.
Time of Day: Time at which the delivery is made (morning, afternoon, etc.).
Historical Delivery Time: Previous delivery times for similar routes and conditions.
The dataset used for this project is either open-source or proprietary and may need further preprocessing before model training.

Modeling
The following models were considered and evaluated for the ETA prediction task:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics, and further hyperparameter tuning was done to optimize the results.

Streamlit Deployment
The project is deployed using Streamlit, which provides an interactive and intuitive UI for end users to input delivery details and get the predicted ETA.

Key Features of the Streamlit App:
User input for delivery distance, traffic, weather, etc.
Real-time predictions of delivery time.
Visualizations of model performance and results.
